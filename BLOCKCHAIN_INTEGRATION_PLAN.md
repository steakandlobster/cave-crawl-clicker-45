- claimWinnings(uint256 gameId)
- getGameStatus(uint256 gameId)
```

**Benefits:**
- Provably fair gameplay
- Transparent reward distribution
- Immutable game history

### 2. Achievements & NFTs (Medium Priority)
**What to store on-chain:**
- Achievement unlocks as NFT mints
- Rare achievement badges
- Progression milestones

**Implementation:**
- ERC-721 or ERC-1155 for achievement NFTs
- Metadata stored on IPFS
- Automatic minting on achievement unlock

### 3. Leaderboards (Medium Priority)

- Top player rankings
- Weekly/monthly competitions
- Prize pool distributions

**Benefits:**
- Trustless leaderboards
- Automated prize distribution
- Global competition transparency

### 4. User Profiles (Low Priority)
**What to store on-chain:**

- Profile customization items
- Referral relationships

### 5. Credits/Economy (High Priority)
**What to store on-chain:**
- In-game currency as ERC-20 tokens
- Wager amounts and payouts
- Withdrawal/deposit system

**Implementation:**
- Cave Coins (CVC) ERC-20 token
- Faucet for new players
- Exchange with ETH

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Game Contracts
1. Deploy game session contract
2. Integrate start/play/claim functions
3. Add provable fairness mechanism

### Phase 2: Economy
1. Deploy Cave Coin (CVC) token
2. Integrate token rewards
3. Add faucet for new players

### Phase 3: Social Features
1. Achievement NFT contract
2. On-chain leaderboards
3. Referral system rewards

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Cross-game item trading
2. Seasonal tournaments
3. DAO governance for game parameters

## Technical Requirements

### Smart Contracts Needed:
1. `CaveExplorerGame.sol` - Main game logic
2. `CaveCoin.sol` - ERC-20 reward token
3. `AchievementNFT.sol` - ERC-721 achievements
4. `Leaderboard.sol` - Rankings and prizes
5. `CaveFaucet.sol` - Free tokens for new players

### Frontend Integration:
1. Contract interaction hooks
2. Transaction status tracking
3. Gas optimization
4. Error handling for failed transactions
5. Offline mode fallback

### Data Migration:
- Current Supabase data can remain for:
  - User preferences
  - Game analytics
  - Social features
  - Cache layer for blockchain data

## Security Considerations
1. Reentrancy protection
2. Access controls
3. Emergency pause mechanisms
4. Upgradeability patterns
5. Audit requirements

## Gas Optimization
1. Batch operations where possible
2. Use events for data storage
3. Minimize on-chain computation
4. Consider Layer 2 solutions

This plan allows for gradual blockchain integration while maintaining current functionality.
