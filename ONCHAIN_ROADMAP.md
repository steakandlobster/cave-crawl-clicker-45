# Cave Explorer On-Chain Roadmap

## ✅ Completed
- AGW wallet integration with Abstract blockchain
- Network switching between Abstract testnet and mainnet
- Wallet-based authentication system
- Referral system with database tracking
- Basic smart contract interaction UI

## 🚧 Critical Next Steps

### Phase 1: Smart Contract Development (1-2 weeks)

#### 1. Core Game Contract (`CaveExplorerGame.sol`)
```solidity
// Key functions needed:
- startGame(uint256 maxRounds, bytes32 clientSeed) payable
- playRound(uint256 gameId, uint8 caveChoice, bytes32 serverSeed)
- verifyAndClaim(uint256 gameId, bytes32 serverSeed, bytes32[] calldata proof)
- getGameStatus(uint256 gameId)
```

**Features to implement:**
- Commit-reveal scheme for provable fairness
- Wager handling with configurable house edge
- Multi-round game state management
- Emergency pause/resume functionality

#### 2. Cave Coin Token (`CaveCoin.sol`)
```solidity
// ERC-20 token for in-game economy
- Standard ERC-20 functions
- Minting for game rewards
- Burning for special features
- Staking mechanisms
```

#### 3. Achievement NFTs (`CaveAchievements.sol`)
```solidity
// ERC-721 for achievement badges
- Dynamic metadata based on achievement type
- Soulbound tokens (non-transferable)
- Batch minting for multiple achievements
```

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration (1 week)

#### 1. Game Flow Integration
- Connect existing game logic to smart contracts
- Real-time transaction status tracking
- Handle failed transactions gracefully
- Offline mode fallback

#### 2. Economy Integration
- Token balance display
- Reward distribution UI
- Staking interface
- Transaction history

#### 3. Achievement System
- NFT collection display
- Achievement unlock animations
- Rarity indicators
- Sharing functionality

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (2 weeks)

#### 1. Provable Fairness UI
- Server seed reveal interface
- Game verification tools
- Fairness audit trail
- Educational tooltips

#### 2. Leaderboard Contract
- On-chain rankings
- Prize pool management
- Automated payouts
- Seasonal competitions

#### 3. Governance Features
- Parameter voting (house edge, rewards, etc.)
- Community proposals
- Treasury management

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Smart Contract Deployment Strategy

**Testnet First:**
1. Deploy all contracts to Abstract testnet
2. Comprehensive testing with real users
3. Security audit and bug fixes
4. Frontend integration testing

**Mainnet Deployment:**
1. Final security review
2. Deploy with multisig ownership
3. Gradual feature rollout
4. Community announcement

### Data Migration Strategy

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Keep Supabase for user preferences, analytics, caching
- Move game sessions, rewards, achievements to blockchain
- Use events for data synchronization
- Implement robust error handling

### Gas Optimization

**Strategies:**
1. Batch operations where possible
2. Use events instead of storage for historical data
3. Implement meta-transactions for gasless UX
4. Consider state channels for rapid gameplay
